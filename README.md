10 # Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

In this activity, I've created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app will take in drink orders for customers and deplete stock from the drink's inventory. As a bonus task, I've programed the app to track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store once more departments added.
